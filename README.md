About Dataset
Context
The dataset contains over 41 million cleaned and preprocessed user recommendations (reviews) from a Steam Store - a leading online platform for purchasing and downloading video games, DLC, and other gaming-related content. Additionally, it contains detailed information about games and add-ons.

Content
The dataset consists of three main entities:

games.csv - a table of games (or add-ons) information on ratings, pricing in US dollars $, release date, etc. A piece of extra non-tabular details on games, such as descriptions and tags, is in a metadata file;
users.csv - a table of user profiles' public information: the number of purchased products and reviews published;
recommendations.csv - a table of user reviews: whether the user recommends a product. The table represents a many-many relation between a game entity and a user entity.
